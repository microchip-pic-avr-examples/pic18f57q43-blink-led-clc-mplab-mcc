# Hello World

This example shows how to configure the TMR0, and CLC on the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano to blink an LED using drivers in MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC). The example uses the Pin Manager to configure the correct pin to be an output and to provide the correct output voltage for Blinking the LED.

## Setup

MCC with the Melody library was used to implement this example as shown in the following section.
## TMR0 Configuration
In the Device Resources window click the dropdown arrow next to "Drivers" to expand the choices

*Device Resources*

In the TMR0 / Easy View select Prescaler of 1:512, Clock Source of FOSC/4, Disable Syncronisation, and type in 0.5 for the requested period which comes out to 500ms. Notice actual period calculated by MPLAB.

## CLC Configuration
In the Device Resources window scroll to find "CLC" click the dropdown arrow to expand the choices

For CLC settings select J K flip-flop with R from the dropdown menu. on Gate picture first input select TMR0 for the input to the clock of the J K flip-flop and complete the connecion by clicking on the first input to OR gate 1. click on the output boxes on OR gate 2 and 4 to create a 1 input to the J K flip-flop. This configuration should toggle the output of CLC1_out every time TMR0 rolls over.

## Pin Configuration
The Pin controlling the onboard LED on the Curiosity Nano board was configured using the Pins Grid View. The Pins Grid View is accessed by clicking on the Pins line in Project Resources.

## Operation

After having flashed the application to the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano, the onboard LED Blinks as the application code operates.

## Summary

The example has shown how MCC can be used to easily configure TMR0, CLC module and output pins of the PIC18F57Q43 device.
